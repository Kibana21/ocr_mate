# Navigation Structure Update - Complete

## Summary

All HTML pages have been updated to show proper document-centric navigation and context awareness, per user requirement: **"ensure that in none of the screens it shows only the top level menu. it should also show only the local menus"**

## Global Navigation Structure

All pages now use this consistent top-level navigation:

```html
<nav class="nav">
  <a href="index.html">Dashboard</a>
  <a href="document-types.html">Document Types</a>
  <a href="process-documents.html">Process</a>
  <a href="01-model-selector.html">Settings</a>
</nav>
```

## Page-by-Page Status

## Context Awareness Features

### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
All document type-specific pages show breadcrumbs:
```html
<div class="mb-lg" style="font-size: var(--font-size-sm); color: var(--text-secondary);">
  <a href="index.html">Dashboard</a> /
  <a href="document-types.html">Document Types</a> /
  <a href="document-type-invoice.html">Invoice</a> /
  <span>Current Page</span>
</div>
```

### 2. Document Type Badges
Pages show which document type they belong to:
```html
<h2 class="card-title">
  Page Title
  <span class="badge badge-info">Invoice</span>
</h2>
```

### 3. Back Navigation
All pages have "Back to Invoice" buttons that return to the correct tab:
```html
<button onclick="window.location.href='document-type-invoice.html?tab=analytics'">
  ← Back to Invoice
</button>
```

### 4. URL Parameters
Pages use URL parameters to maintain context:
- `?document_type=invoice` - Tells annotation which document type is being edited
- `?tab=schema` - Opens document type detail to specific tab

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Incorrect):
- Schema Editor was standalone global page
- Annotation, Optimization, Results had their own top-level navigation
- No way to know which document type you were working with
- Confusing navigation - users got lost

### After (Correct):
- Everything scoped to document type
- Clear hierarchy: Dashboard → Document Types → [Specific Type] → Tab/Action
- Breadcrumbs show path back
- Context always visible (badges, titles, back buttons)
- Users always know where they are

## Testing Checklist

To verify navigation works correctly:

- [ ] Click Dashboard - should go to [index.html](index.html)
- [ ] Click Document Types - should go to [document-types.html](document-types.html)
- [ ] Click Invoice card - should go to [document-type-invoice.html](document-type-invoice.html)
- [ ] Within Invoice, click Schema tab - should show schema editor
- [ ] Within Invoice, click Ground Truth tab - should show examples
- [ ] Click "Edit" on an example - should go to [03-annotation.html?document_type=invoice](03-annotation.html?document_type=invoice)
- [ ] In annotation, click "Back to Invoice" - should return to [document-type-invoice.html?tab=examples](document-type-invoice.html?tab=examples)
- [ ] Within Invoice, click Pipeline tab - should show pipeline info
- [ ] Click "Optimize Pipeline" - should go to [04-optimization.html](04-optimization.html) with Invoice context
- [ ] In optimization, click "Back to Invoice Pipeline" - should return to pipeline tab
- [ ] Within Invoice, click Analytics tab - should show processing history
- [ ] Click "View" on a processed document - should go to [05-results.html](05-results.html) with Invoice context
- [ ] In results, click "Back to Invoice" - should return to analytics tab
- [ ] Click Settings in top nav - should go to [01-model-selector.html](01-model-selector.html)
- [ ] Try to visit [02-schema-editor.html](02-schema-editor.html) - should see redirect message and auto-redirect

## Future Considerations

### Multi-Document Type Support
When adding more document types (Receipt, Contract, Tax Forms), each will have its own:
- `document-type-receipt.html` with tabs
- `document-type-contract.html` with tabs
- etc.

The same context-aware pages (annotation, optimization, results) will be reused with different URL parameters:
- `03-annotation.html?document_type=receipt`
- `04-optimization.html?document_type=contract`
- `05-results.html?document_type=tax_form`

### Missing Page
**process-documents.html** is referenced in navigation but not yet created. This should be a page where users can:
- Upload new documents
- Select document type
- Run extraction
- View batch processing status

## Summary

✅ **All pages now have consistent navigation**
✅ **All document type-specific pages show context (breadcrumbs, badges, back buttons)**
✅ **Old standalone schema editor replaced with redirect page**
✅ **Architecture is now properly document-centric**

The user's requirement has been fully addressed: **"in none of the screens it shows only the top level menu. it should also show only the local menus"** - all pages now show both top navigation AND document type context where applicable.
