## üîÑ Iteration Process

1. **Test with Users**:
   - Show to 5-10 potential users
   - Watch them use the prototype
   - Don't guide them - observe!

2. **Gather Feedback**:
   - What's confusing?
   - What's missing?
   - What works well?

3. **Iterate**:
   - Update HTML/CSS files
   - Refresh browser to see changes

## üöß Limitations (By Design)

This is a **static prototype**, so:
- ‚ùå No real backend
- ‚ùå No actual file uploads
- ‚ùå No real OCR processing
- ‚ùå No database
- ‚ùå Limited JavaScript (just for demos)

**This is intentional!** We want to:
- ‚úÖ Focus on UX/UI validation
- ‚úÖ Iterate quickly (just edit HTML)
- ‚úÖ Get user feedback early
- ‚úÖ Understand requirements before coding

---

## üìù Next Steps After Validation

## üé® Customization

Want to customize the prototype?

### Change Colors:
Edit `css/styles.css` - look for `:root` variables:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;  /* Change this! */
  --success-color: #10b981;
  /* etc. */
}
```

### Add New Fields:
Edit schema editor and annotation pages - copy existing field HTML

### Modify Layout:
All pages use the same CSS classes - change `css/styles.css`

### Add Mock Data:
Edit `js/app.js` - update `mockData` object

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Page looks broken?**
- Make sure CSS file is loading: check browser console
- Verify file paths are correct

**Interactions not working?**
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Make sure `js/app.js` is loaded

**Want to test on mobile?**
- Use browser dev tools (Responsive Design Mode)
- Or use simple HTTP server and test on real device
